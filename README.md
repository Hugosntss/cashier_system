# Cashier System Program <sub> by Hugo Santos </sub>

//


 This program is a cashier system that allows the worker keep track of everything that the costumer asked for their food. 
And each item in the menu can cause a different value at the end of the bill, so each item will have a unique price. 

Also the program will count with taxes in California, which is 7%. And the program will show the total price before taxes and after taxes. 
And if the costumer is a student, then they can get 15% discount in the total price of their food.
